          <p>Working from home is the new normal, and as our customer interviews confirm, almost all companies will continue to work from home after the Corona crisis. However, 45% of the people that are working from home, are working in problematic conditions, meaning they donâ€™t meet the legal space requirements. Also, 38% of the people working from home have suffered from shoulder, neck or arm since working from home, and this number is expected to rise (CNV, 2021). A wrong seat height or insufficient light can lead to stress and tiredness- and in the long-term to physical injuries. In a stationary office, regular workplace checks are required to create a workplace that is safe and healthy to work in. But with all employees working remotely, it is a very challenging and labor-intensive task to ensure the workplace quality of all employees. Based on these conditions, we created a solution that is quick, and easy to implement in this new normal.</p>

          <p>GleamLink is Plattform accesssible for employees via an app. It contains features to scan a workplace and gives feedback on its quality and tips for improvement. A safe and healthy workplace can therefore be assured, and disturbing environments, such as a bad lighting situation or high accoustic stresses, can be identified and eliminated. Furthermore, it can be assured that the working conditions at home are matching the regulatory requirements. GleamLink provides a healthy workplace for employees and employers can rely on less mental and physical caused by unsuited workplaces.

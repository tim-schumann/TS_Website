          <p>The course „Made by Robots“ was all about using robotic clay printing to create habitats for urban
            wildlife. A specific plot in the outskirts of Melbourne was choosen to locate the project. In an
            initial analysis, we identified endangered species in this specific urban ecological system, which are
            mostly birds and frogs. We choose to build a feeding station for them- meaning to create the optimum
            conditions for funghi and mosses to grow. Once funghi and mosses are populated, smaller animals like
            slugs, spiders and ants will follow. These animals then are serving as food for the endangered frog
            and bird populations. To create the design, we did several experiments on how to grow mosses and
            funghi in combination with clay printing.</p>

          <p>We identified the perfect conditions regarding geometry, humidity and sunlight. Based on that, we
            developed modular clay elements, each serving a specific function for growing fungi, mosses, and
            transporting moisture and light.
            For that, four different kinds of prints are produced: Bottom Pieces, Top Pieces, Regular Pieces and
            Connectors. While Connectors and Regular Pieces can be connected with two other prints, Bottom- and
            Top Pieces can only connect to one other element.
            The result are modular pieces, that can be freely assembled to towers, with internal properties to
            match the local requirements. Three of these towers have been assembled on the chosen site and are
            currently populated by fungi and mosses. The project will be exhibited at Melbourne Design Week 2023.

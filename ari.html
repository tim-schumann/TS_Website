          <p>The Architectural Research Incubator combines workspace for students of the Faculty of Architecture
            at RWTH Aachen with public exhibition space. To perfectly implement the room schedule, we created a
            compact high building for the workplaces and an elongated, representative building for exhibitions. In
            both typologies, the social interaction space is in the foreground, so all floors are occupied by one
            single main room. In the tall house, this room is flanked by two cores which have a stiffening effect.
            Structurally, it is a timber frame construction. In conjunction with the cores made from glued
            laminated timber, a pure wooden construction is created.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <p>The structural use of wooden elements is made possible by using full-thread screws. These provide a
            reinforcement for the highly stressed glulam cross sections. Of course, fire protection is of
            particular importance to this timber construction. This is ensured by a burnup impact on the wood
            cross sections and by cladding the cores. The facade of the skyscraper is constructed as a double
            facade. This is done entirely in glass to provide the students with optimal light conditions during
            their work. The interspace of the double facade acts as a thermal buffer zone in summer and winter, it
            also allows a natural fresh air supply through a chimney effect. Therefore the tall house can do
            without a ventilation system.

                <p>One million homes will be needed in the Netherlands by 2030. Prefabrication in the construction
                  industry
                  can contribute to construct affordable houses, but that results often in standardized and not
                  customized
                  designs. These repetitive designs can be overcome through the introduction of mass-customization in
                  architecture. Computational Architectural Design offers the possibility to tackle mass-customization
                  through
                  developing tools to let the user easily customize a design while providing guidelines and feedback
                  towards a
                  successful building design. This can be done by discretising a building into building blocks that can
                  be
                  controlled through a computational workflow.</p>

                <p>This project elaborates on the potential of developing a design tool that allows the customization of
                  houses
                  through discrete building information modelling. Since the housing design process is a complex and
                  multi-layered problem, the process is broken down into the sub-problems of topological design,
                  building
                  product development, configuration, and data export. For these steps, algorithms from the gaming
                  industry
                  are tested to improve the participation of the end user trough a simplification of the design process.
                  Through design grammars, a relational data structure is created that is compatible to the BIM
                  environment of
                  the industry.
                  The evolved methods are applied to the test case of a rowhouse design in Delft to predict the possible
                  impact of the design tool. The results of this are set in the context of the AEC industry.

                <p>Tetris Living tackles the inefficiency in the current building industry with a proposal for
                  architecture. Buildings should respond to the changed needs of the inhabitants, and allow the
                  individualization and reconfiguration of their living spaces. This can be done with the discretization
                  of architecture. Specifically, this means that buildings are assembled out of a set of few components,
                  allowing a huge range of possible configurations. The first step is the development of a part,
                  suitable for the built environment. The part is then aggregated to shape a building following a
                  certain logic.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p>The aggregation and the concept of discrete architecture as a participatory platform is tested in an
                  architectural project, located in the Fishermen’s Bend, a new urban development area in Melbourne.
                  As a discrete part, a timber beam with triangular section was developed. These parts can be assembled
                  to frames. A row of frames can be assembled to rooms, and rooms can be stacked upon each other thanks
                  to the triangular section of the parts. Through an interactive platform, inhabitants can choose their
                  preferred room configuration. Following that, the apartments are stacked with the goal of maximum
                  space efficiency.

                <p>The concept of the design studio „Earthy“ is the
                  development of semi-temporary accommodations
                  and buildings for the refugee camp „Zataari“
                  in Jordan. Buildings are to be created from local
                  materials such as compressed earth blocks. The
                  construction process needs to be highly simplified
                  so that camp inhabitants can participate in
                  the construction themselves.
                  “Shifa´s Mosaics” is translated with “Mosaics of
                  Healing” and tackles the typology of a healthand-
                  wellness centre for the camp. In the first
                  step, the ideal location for the centre was defined
                  by computing the camp region with the most
                  need for these services.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p>Then, a room program was created that reflects the requirements and
                  wishes of the camp inhabitants. Incorporating
                  the historic typology of the courtyard house, a
                  generative design methodology was developed
                  to produce valid spatial configurations, centred
                  around courtyards. One iteration was chosen to
                  detail further. With rib vaults and muqarnas, suitable
                  roof constructions are generated for each
                  space. Finally, the construction is validated with
                  a structural analysis and assembly guidelines are
                  produced to support the camp inhabitants with
                  the construction.

                <p>Hexaform shifts the production process for free form buildings on a whole new level, based on a modular lightweight construction. Hexaform is a building system working with the automation of sheet metal folding. The basis is formed by prefabricated hexagon pyramids, which are riveted together and stiffed with a framework. The results in a spatial folding that is based on the principles of origami. With the precise coordination of the individual folding processes, a spatial free-form surface of pyramids is created.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-6">
                <p>The framework is also a variable structure: 
                  with the help of threaded rods, the length of the rod can be shortened or lengthened and can thus react to the changed distances of the spatially curved pyramid structure. The folding and pre-assembly process is carried out in a fully automated mobile factory.  Since all components are preserved in their shape and length, Hexaform can be completely dismantled and is therefore suitable for both temporary and stationary free-form constructions.

                  <p>The course „Made by Robots“ was all about using robotic clay printing to create habitats for urban wildlife. A specific plot in the outskirts of Melbourne was choosen to locate the project. In an initial analysis, we identified endangered species in this specific urban ecological system, which are mostly birds and frogs. We choose to build a feeding station for them- meaning to create the optimum conditions for funghi and mosses to grow. Once funghi and mosses are populated, smaller animals like slugs, spiders and ants will follow. These animals then are serving as food for the endangered frog and bird populations. To create the design, we did several experiments on how to grow mosses and funghi in combination with clay printing.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-6">
                  <p>We identified the perfect conditions regarding geometry, humidity and sunlight. Based on that, we developed modular clay elements, each serving a specific function for growing fungi, mosses, and transporting moisture and light. 
                    For that, four different kinds of prints are produced: Bottom Pieces, Top Pieces, Regular Pieces and Connectors. While Connectors and Regular Pieces can be connected with two other prints, Bottom- and Top Pieces can only connect to one other element. 
                    The result are modular pieces, that can be freely assembled to towers, with internal properties to match the local requirements. Three of these towers have been assembled on the chosen site and are currently populated by fungi and mosses. The project will be exhibited at Melbourne Design Week 2023.

                  <p>The Façade Design Competition was embedded within the Master´s course „Façade Design“. The task was the creation of a free-form pavilion using a specific glass façade system by Jansen in combination with 3D-printed metal façade nodes. The number of nodes, as same as the change of angle incorporated in the nodes, was strictly limited. Our proposal was a public transport station with a tree-like structure in the middle, transitioning into a windshield.</p>

                  <p>The 3D-printed nodes should be created with the DMLS technique. This method allows high printing accuracy and allows us to integrate an optical sensor and a light into the node. Through this addition, the pavilion can interact with waiting people by tracking their movements or showing relevant information, such as a warning light indicating a bus or ferry approaching. As an initial location, a prominent position in the harbour of Rotterdam was chosen. Our proposal was awarded the first prize in the competition by a Jury consisting of delegates from Jansen, Knippers Helbig and gmp architects.

                      <p>The European Readr is an initiative of the European Union to harvest interest in culture across Europe. Each country was challenged to contribute a project to the theme of 2021: „Open a book for a better future“. EUNIC Netherlands created a student competition, which we could win with our proposal. Our concept reacts to the idea of reading by creating three over-dimensioned books, each serving a specific task. The first book, „Inspire“, offers visitors to download books that are offered for free by the partner initiatives of all countries of the EU. The second book, „Dive In“, offers a space to sit down and read. Finally, the third book, „Inspire“, challenges the visitors to leave book recommendations on colourful bookmarks in an imaginary landscape of the Netherlands.</p>

                      <p>Once the competition was won, we developed a realization concept to build the pavilion within the material budget of 10.000 EUR. Thanks to being able to use the facilities of the Faculty of Architecture at TU Delft, we constructed the books from timber profiles and plywood sheets. The rounded shape of the podium was achieved through CNC milling, and the book pages and envelopes were produced by a specialized printing company. The pavilion was constructed for easy disassembly, so it could be exhibited in multiple locations. After construction, the pavilion was exhibited at OBA Amsterdam, Biblionet Veendam, Emmen and Delft.
